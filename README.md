# SMS Spam Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a text classification model to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam using data science techniques in Python. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, and training a machine learning model for text classification.

## Project Description
The project involves the following key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand patterns and relationships.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical features.
4. **Model Training**: Building and training a predictive model to classify SMS messages.

## Objectives
Import and clean data.
Visualize the distribution of a chosen variable using a bar chart or histogram.
Interpret the visualized data to derive meaningful insights.

## Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data manipulation and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment for writing and running code.
Pandas: Data manipulation library.
Matplotlib: Visualization library for creating static plots.
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
